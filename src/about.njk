        <p style="font-size: 18px; color: var(--color-gray-light); margin-bottom: var(--space-lg);">
            Dwello was founded by California transplants who experienced firsthand the challenges—and rewards—of relocating to Phoenix. We know what it's like to research neighborhoods from 400 miles away, to wonder if you're making the right choice, and to start over in a new city.
        </p>
        
        <h2 style="margin-bottom: var(--space-md);">Why "Dwello"?</h2>
        <p>
            Our name comes from "dwell"—to live, to reside, to make a home. We believe finding a house is just the beginning. What matters is finding a place where you truly belong.
        </p>
        
        <h2 style="margin-top: var(--space-xl); margin-bottom: var(--space-md);">Our Approach</h2>
        <p>
            We're not a volume brokerage trying to close as many transactions as possible. We specialize in one thing: helping California families relocate to Phoenix with confidence.
        </p>
        <p>This means:</p>
        <ul style="margin: var(--space-md) 0; padding-left: var(--space-md);">
            <li>The agent who answers your first call is the agent who hands you your keys</li>
            <li>We provide neighborhood analysis tailored to YOUR priorities—not generic listings</li>
            <li>We offer virtual preview days for out-of-state buyers</li>
            <li>Our relationship continues after closing with our transition concierge service</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2 style="margin-top: var(--space-xl); margin-bottom: var(--space-md);">Our Promise</h2>
        <p>
            Moving across state lines is a major life decision. We take that seriously. Our goal isn't just to help you buy a house—it's to help you feel at home in Phoenix faster.
